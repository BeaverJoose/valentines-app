  `I never feel like I'm <br />
  wasting time <br />
  with you,<br />
  We could sit <br />
  in silence for hours<br />
  and it would still feel 
  so full <br />
  and good <br />
  and necessary<br />
  I'm so thankful for you`,

  `Love is not a race to win <br />
  It is the quiet place<br />
  between the noise,<br />
  Where you can breathe<br />
  And begin again`,

  `You don't have to reach for me <br />
  I am already here<br />
  Not to pull<br />
  Just to listen<br />
  Just to know you`,

  `Even when you say nothing <br />
  I hear you<br />
  Even when you turn away<br />
  I see you<br />
  Even when you need space<br />
  I love you`,

  `If our time together <br />
  is a collection of moments<br />
  Let me be a quiet one<br />
  Not the loudest, nor the brightest<br />
  But the one you return to<br />
  when the world feels too much`,

  `Some days, the weight is yours,<br />
  Some days, it’s mine.<br />
  But we walk the same road,<br />
  Through the same storm,<br />
  With hands never forced—only offered.`,

  `You don’t have to run,<br />
  You don’t have to stay.<br />
  Love is not a choice between the two—<br />
  It’s a place<br />
  That exists whenever you need it.`,

  `I do not love you in shouts,<br />
  Nor in grand displays.<br />
  I love you in the quiet,<br />
  In the pause between words—<br />
  Where you are safest, where you are heard.`,

  `If your heart needs distance,<br />
  Take all the miles you need.<br />
  I would rather love you from afar<br />
  Than hold you too close<br />
  And make you leave.`,

  `You are not mine to keep,<br />
  Nor to hold too tight.<br />
  You are yours first,<br />
  And I will love you best<br />
  By never forgetting that.`,

  `If you never say it back,<br />
  I will love you still.<br />
  For love, at its best,<br />
  Is not an echo—<br />
  It is an offering.`,

  `I won’t say I love you,<br />
  I won’t make a scene,<br />
  I’ll just stare at you quietly<br />
  Until you ask,<br />
  "Why are you looking at me like that?"`,

  `Loving you is like an escape room,<br />
  No obvious clues, no easy doors.<br />
  But I don’t mind the puzzle—<br />
  Because every time I find my way in,<br />
  It’s the best room ever.`,

  `You don’t have to text me daily,<br />
  Or call me every night.<br />
  Just, you know,<br />
  Maybe send a tiktok<br />
  So I know we’re still good.`,

  `We do not need directions,<br />
  No paths, no rules.<br />
  We are not lost, Avalon—<br />
  We are just two hearts<br />
  Finding our way.`,

  `Not a love that asks for more,<br />
  Not a love that pulls too tight.<br />
  But a love that moves beside you—<br />
  Soft as moonlight,<br />
  Steady as dawn.`,
